            I am now a few weeks into 'purple badge'.  This is a time where most graduates of my class are continuing their lerning path and 
            looking for employment.  The great thing with this is some other classmates are available, the instructors are still available if you have 
            any blockers, and of course career services is helping with job connections.  My plan right after graduating was to dive a little deeper into React
            and begin a new project.  Also, continue to touch up and expand on my JavaScript fundamentals.  However, I was presented with an internship opportunity
            that career services at Eleven Fifty thought I would be a good fit for.  Therefore, for the time being I have switched my focus.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              This particular internship is more interested and involved with .NET, C#, and SQL database.  Once I found out about this opportunity, all I have done
              is focus on these topics, especially SQL.  Currently I have only used the ORM sequelize to create or access a database.  Diving into actual SQL commands and getting more detailed with
              that helped give a better overall picture of what was actually happening.  I never really like Pluralsight in comparison to other learning platforms when it came to JavaScript topics, however I have found they seem to be great for .NET topics.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              So far for SQL I have taken
              Jon Flanders Intro to SQL course, <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/introduction-to-sql/table-of-contents" target="_blank">Introduction to SQL</a> and a course available on Udemy by Jose Portilla, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/" target="_blank">The Complete SQL Bootcamp</a>.
              I initally took the Pluralsight course and really thought the explanations were great.  After that I took the Udemy course and really liked it because it uses PGAdmin which I am familiar with.  Also,
              I got much more hands-on practice with querying and creating tables.  They both are good in their own way but I really liked them taken together.  For C#, I have really focused on Mosh Hamedani's courses available on Udemy, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=mosh+hamedani" target="_blank">All Mosh Courses on Udemy</a> and his personal site <a href="https://codewithmosh.com" target="_blank">codewithmosh.com</a>.
              Mosh is great so I always see what he has available first before looking elsewhere.

              When working and dealing with more .NET and C#, I found that it can be
              a good thing to have access to Windows operating system.  I typically code on a Mac but Visual Studio Community doesn't have all the options, bells, and whistles
              available to you like the Windows version does.  Therefore, I decided to dual-boot my 2015 Macbook Pro.  This is a great option, is simple, and I haven't noticed any performance
              issues.  The only thing I ran into was my MacBook had 256Gb SSD and I was already somewhat lacking on space.  Therefore, I also decided to upgrade to 512Gb SSD.  I used this video by Craig Beckta <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOayO4U9CJo" target="_blank">Install Windows 10 on MAC with Bootcamp</a>.
              If you are wanting to preserve all of your current data on your Mac and move it to your new hard drive, you will need an external drive to perform a time machine backup.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I used this video from MacSales.com <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K3n5TWgmSU" target="_blank">Upgrade SSD MacBook Pro 2015</a>
                to swap out the SSD.
              I purchased my new SSD from eBay seller HATSSD which is really from a company by the name of Fledging <a href="https://fledging.net/">https://fledging.net</a>.  They have fast SSD's for Apple products at a great price.  Another thing is Windows 10 can be a bit expensive.  I bought a product from G2deal.com for around $15
              and it worked great and haven't had an issue.  Basically, once I sell my previous SSD, I will have spent around $60 to double my hard drive space and dual-boot to Windows 10 Pro on my Macbook, Sweet!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Getting back to the internship opportunity, I have had a phone interview and an in-person interview.  Both went really well and I should hear back about it after this weekend on Monday.  For this weekend, I am just going to continue to focus on C# in preparation of taking this opportunity.
              If this doesn't work out, I will probably go back to my original plan of diving more into React/JS and building something new.  Let the job hunt continue.
