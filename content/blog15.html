            Week 5 has come and gone. This week we focused on node.js, backend development. I gotta be honest, not that exciting for
            me. Yes, I am struggling to totally grasp and master React, but I just miss the frontend. With React I just feel
            like I can power through problems for hours and not get so burnt out. With node, I just get frustrated a little
            quicker and typically the answer is something very small that I missed. This is really my first experience doing
            anything with the backend so maybe over time I will get more comfortable and change my mind. Maybe when we begin
            our full-stack project next week and I see the two interconnecting, I will begin to enjoy it more.

            We spent Monday through Thursday, going through a "gitbook" node project. This project really shows us how to implement CRUD(Create,
            read, update, and delete) using node, express, and postgres in collaboration with one another. This way when
            we get to our full-stack project we can implement these principles. Fortunately, our instructor also built another
            small side project and walked us through each section as a class. This was great because now we get our own perspective
            using the book and we get his explanation as well while going through the side project. I like to see things
            through as many different lenses as possible so I can grasp the material better.

            Friday morning, we had a contracts and IP workshop. This was a lawyer talking to us about different business types with advantages
            and disadvantages. He also covered contract law and things to look for with employment contracts. Finally, he
            covered intellectual property law, such as trademarks and copyright. There was some good information here but
            some of it could probably be cut out and it should have been more like an hour long talk instead of 2.5 - 3 hours.
            Either way, I do appreciate him taking his time to share his knowledge on these subjects with us.

            Friday afternoon, we had a UX/UI (user experience, user interface) workshop. Once again, there was a lot of valuable information
            here and it was definitely purposeful. It was nice to have the perspective of a UX/UI professional with many
            years of experience firsthand. However, just like with the morning workshop, I just feel it should have been
            much shorter. During these workshops, all I can think about is the code. This program is already immersive and
            extremely compacted. Time is the most valuable resource in the world and time management is beyond crucial at
            this point. In my opinion, I think they need to trim some fat off these workshops.

            Not the most exciting week for me but we had solid instruction and guidance this week. I am really excited for the next few
            weeks. We will be receiving our full-stack project assignment for blue badge on Monday. Obviously, I don't have
            the specifics yet but I do know it will involve using React and the backend technologies learned this week. I'm
            really diving into React even more this weekend and I am hyped for this project. It will definitely be difficult
            but I am really hoping I can make this project shine for me. So much to learn and do, so little time.
