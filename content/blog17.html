            If you are going to go through a coding bootcamp, definitely be prepared for highs and lows. At times I have felt like I
            know so much and I'm on top of the world. Next day, I feel like I don't know anything and wonder how in the heck
            is anyone else a developer -- because it is just too tough with way too many things to know. After completing
            Gold badge, I felt like I was on top of the 'coding' world. Once Blue badge began and React and Node got thrown
            in the mix, I went from hero to zero.

          <p>This week, after being in a never-ending valley the last two to three weeks, I can finally see the top of a
            hill again. During orientation we were given the chart shown above. It is definitely a chart that mirrors reality.
            However, I feel like it should have multiple small hills and valleys before the final acsension. I feel like
            the last few weeks I have thought I was on the upswing only to get knocked back down into a valley. Maybe there
            isn't really a final acsension, maybe you just go through the cycle over and over. Instead though, the valleys
            just get smaller and smaller. Plus, you start going through it so many times, you know to be more patient and
            you realize that the light at the end of the tunnel does exist.

            This past weekend I rewrote my backend code for like the 4th time. I really wanted to understand everything as well as possible
            and get the finished code just how I wanted. So far this week it appears to have paid off and I was able to focus
            solely on the front-end as planned. What wasn't planned was at every turn there seemed to be an issue that I
            just couldn't solve right away. React is a great library and can be powerful in the right hands. However, it
            can quickly get confusing with so many different components and prop passing. I gained a lot of valuable experience
            and knowledge this week though.

            All of the different problems I ran into have solutions. Going through the struggle of finding the solutions that work and
            the experience of seeing those solutions firsthand is invaluable. I can draw from these experiences and remember
            certain patterns that come with those solutions. Also, there is nothing better than running into a coding problem
            with your app and then finally solving it on your own.

            Whether in life, your profession, or like me in this programming bootcamp -- It would be great to always be on top of the
            mountain. However, that is just not how things work, it's not reality. Everyone needs those trials and troubles
            to get to the top. The tough times make you stronger and able to get where you ultimately want to go. Most importantly,
            they give you an apprecation for what you earn when you finally arrive at the 'destination'.

          <p>This song by Tauren Wells is just incredible. He has more talent in his pinkie finger than I have in my whole
            body. He doesn't just sing this song but he also wrote it. A true artist and master of his craft. His performance
            just feels effortless...phenomonally beautiful and powerful! Simply brilliant! I hope to one day be seen as a
            master of my craft. It is years away (if ever) and I have so many hills and valleys in between before I even
            begin to reach that point. I want to get to that pinnacle but I think I'm going to try and focus on the small
            repeated steps it takes to get there. All the while trying my best to appreciate the journey.
