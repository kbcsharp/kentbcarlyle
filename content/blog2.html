          <p>
            My first goal after orientation was to make a personal website with a blog. I had already seen this advice from many prominent
            developers in the industry. John Sonmez always preaches about how important it is for a developer to create a
            blog. It is a perfect way to showcase who I am, what I am about, and the projects I have been involvded in. Also,
            after completing the personal survey, I realized that I needed something that would help me stand out from the
            rest of the class. I am assuming that we will all have somewhat of the same projects after this program so if
            I can complete other unique projects in addition to those, I will be in a better place.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Even if I wasn't in a programming course with other developers, it is still a good idea to have my own site and blog. Being
            a newer developer, I won't have the work experience that a more seasoned developer may have. Therefore, it is
            even more important to sell myself as well as possible. As time moves on, it will also be interesting to look
            back and reflect on my previous moments and thoughts. I can remember where I came from, the experiences I went
            through, and maybe even laugh at myself. Finally, creating the website and blog gives me more practice using
            relevant tools. I needed to use flexbox, grid, and a little JavaScript for the navigation. The more I create
            and build, the more comfortable and familiar I find myself becoming with these tools.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            It is important to remember that even if I don't create a formal company, my name is my business. My name is my brand. This
            is how I show I care about my brand and that I am a professional. This displays who I am, where I am, and the
            direction I am headed. Next, I will be covering what I have done to prepare for this program and what I will
            be doing for the rest of this week to prepare as well. See you in the next post.
