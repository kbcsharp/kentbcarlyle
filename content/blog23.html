						<h4>#23 The Software Engineer Intern...</h4>
						<p>13 January 2019</p>

					<div class="blog-writing">
						<p>
							I was fortunate enough to be offered the Junior
							Software Engineer position I was going for at J.D.
							Byrider. I accepted the position and I have finished
							my first week on the job. I know they had many
							applicants to choose from, so I am very grateful to
							be given this opportunity. I am very excited to
							begin working in an Agile environment and to be able
							to see firsthand how the work-center operates. They
							ended up hiring myself and another intern. The other
							intern is a CS student who is very close to
							graduating. We are in different stages of our life
							so this should be a lot of fun and make the
							experience even more valuable than it already is.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							This first week we got settled in and received some
							training with our primary tasks. We have also been
							active participants in daily stand-ups as well as
							sprint planning. Everyone is really nice and
							helpful, the work environment is really great. It
							seems the company is really tech focused, so that
							bodes well for the developers. I am glad that I
							focused on SQL and C# to prepare as best I could.
							Especially SQL, since we really didn't directly
							interact with the Database during my training, it
							was vital that I took those two SQL courses.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I don't think it is a good idea to get too specific
							with what we are working on, but I will say we are
							primarily dealing with forms and databases. Most of
							what I have done previously is the web development
							aspect(e.g. React, Node), so this has helped my
							expand my knowledge and see more of the complete
							picture somewhat. The first week is over and I
							didn't delete a production database like this poor
							guy,
							<a
								href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/"
								>Accident DB Deletion</a
							>. Therefore, I would say it has been a good week,
							haha.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I do hope to get back to some more of the web
							development aspects eventually, so for now I am
							continuing to expand my C# knowledge primarily with
							continuing to go through the C# Player's Guide Book.
							It is definitely easier learning C# since I am
							fairly proficient in JavaScript. However, I still
							have so much to learn about C# and even JavaScript
							for that matter. However, I feel like I have a solid
							base to begin ASP.NET Core. I could spend until the
							end of time learning every detail of a language but
							once you feel that you have some kind of decent
							foundation, that is usually the time to start
							building something. You never feel like you are
							ready anyway, so might as well start. Now that I am
							learning ASP.NET Core, as I move along I will run
							into Entity framework and many other things that I
							can dive into and learn more as I go. In comparison
							to Node, so far it seems ASP.NET is more structured
							with it's middleware and I like that. Still, it
							definitely helps having that previous experience
							with Node.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I know many people coming out of a coding bootcamp
							don't want an internship and really just want a
							"real" job right out of the gate. Then again, I know
							some people just aren't able to afford to take an
							internship position. Fortunately, for me, I have
							been given hours that will allow me to gain great
							experience while still being able to run my eBay
							business. Therefore, I can make it work financially.
							If you are able to get an internship and can afford
							to take the lower pay, do it! The experience is
							invaluable. Nothing beats experience! Especially, in
							the software development/engineering space. I am so
							fortunate to have this position and I look forward
							to making the best of it. Hopefully, this is my
							golden ticket to a great software
							development/engineering career.
