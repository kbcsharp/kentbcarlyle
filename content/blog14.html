            If someone was to ask me point blank, "Kent, do you listen and can you take criticism?". I would say, "Oh yeah!, of course,
            this is how I can make myself better and grow". So, I know what I am supposed to do and what makes sense. However,
            do I always actually follow this advice or school of thought? The answer is Nope!
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Nobody wants to hear their shortcomings or faults from others. You justify things by thinking -- that is not me or they must
            have something against me, or some other excuse. You know what? Sometimes that may be the case. However, much
            of the time, it is just an honest appraisal if it is from the right person or persons. People aren't robots and
            everything isn't always exactly black and white. At times I see so many things as simply this or that, black
            or white. I tend to only see the end result and the path in between can get lost or forgotten. Isn't the path
            in between or the journey the whole point.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Once again, something so simple, I decided to make so complicated. All because I didn't want to face or believe
            something about myself. I'm impatient and don't listen as well as I should at times. At least I am beginning
            to listen, slow down, and evaluate. This life is about people. I want to affect people in a positive way. I need
            to start with myself first, always. If I can't understand and help myself, how can I get anywhere with others?
            This weekend, I chose to look at myself. Evaluate myself and listen more. The man in the mirror, I needed to
            start with him.
