          <p>Once I found out I would be able to attend the August JavaScript cohort, I knew I wanted to begin preparing
            right away. First off, I realize that 12 weeks just isn't enough time to deeply learn the amount of information
            that I want to learn. Therefore, I knew it would be wise to learn on my own as much as possible beforehand. Plus,
            I enjoy learning this stuff - it's fun.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I decided to start with taking a Data Structures in JavaScript course and an Algorithms in JavaScript course. Sure, this
            does not equate to a computer science degree but it gives me a good base of understanding for basic structures
            and algorithms I may see on a regular basis. I will say, some of the stuff learned in these courses was daunting.
            I understand everything but I definitely don't feel like I can write out a random algorithm in JS on a whiteboard.
            Next, I started with a JavaScript basics course. Once, I felt comfortable with that information, I moved on to
            a JavaScript Object Oriented programming course. This covered some more advanced topics to include ES6. In addition,
            I always try to spend some time each day on edabit.com to practice JavaScript challenges. This keeps me continually
            using JS, plus it really helps with remembering the common built-in array methods. This is really useful.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            Besides those courses, I also try to follow prominent JS developers on twitter. I am surprised by how much knowledge and
            insight I have gotten from doing this. So much knowledge is shared there everyday, free. In addition, I watch
            a lot of YouTube videos from past JS conferences. Instead of watching some sitcom that has no value, I like to
            flip on a talk from Douglas Crockford or Bob Martin. Both excellent speakers with so much experience and knowledge
            to share. Also, whenever I drive, instead of listening to some tunes - listen to a coding podcast. Just another
            way to get knowledge and learn about how other developers think. I think one of my next blog posts will be about
            all of my favorite resources to learn from - whether listening, reading, or watching.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            Alright, so that is what I have done in the past month. What am I doing now until the program starts next week? Well, since
            you are reading this, it is obvious that I completed my first goal - completing my personal website and blog.
            Next, I plan on finishing some agile pre-work that was added in the learning system from the academy. After that,
            I really want to do a refresh of the 4 courses I completed. The data structures and algorithms as well as the
            JS Basics and OOP courses. I usally find that doing something the second-time around helps solidify what I already
            know. Plus, some of the information where my understanding may have been somewhat foggy, now becomes more clear.
            Finally, over the weekend I really want to dive into learning React.js.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            My goal is to always be ahead of what we are learning in class. There is so much to know and not a lot of time. I think it
            is much easier to grasp something if I have already been introduced to it beforehand. I also want to figure out
            some kind of project using React.js. Right now I am thinking I will try to build an ecommerce site for the business
            I currently own. Obviously, I still don't even know React but hopefully this goal isn't too lofty and out of
            reach. Everyone in the class will have similar projects so I want to work on extra projects that help me stand
            out. Also, React is extremely popular and I really want to learn it. The idea of breaking code down into reusable
            chunks is exciting.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            Well, I have a lot of learning to do so I better get to it. Please realize I do have a job so it is not like I am able to
            spend all day learning and coding etc.. A lot of this work is done over weeknights and weekends out of necessity.
            A big thank you to my wife for putting up with me during these times and always supporting/believing in me. Sometimes
            you have to sacrifice the now for the later. I am not sure where I have heard the phrase "Make Yourself" but
            I like it so much it is on the front of this website. To me, it means you are in control of your own destiny
            and it is up to you to get where you want to go. You have to make who you are. Others can provide resources and
            help, but no one else can actually do it for you.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            My next post will either be about the first week of the program or my favorite learning resources I have used so far. See
            you in the next post...
