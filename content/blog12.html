            With this post I want to cover one of our assignments for the week. Basically, I needed to make a calculator just like the
            photo above. Using HTML, CSS, and JS, the calculaor takes in two input values, and based on the button click,
            the correct reults will display. When I began, the first thing I knew was that I did not want to solve this with
            an onclick function for each button. I knew that wasn't performant and really just not the way it 'should' be
            done. I knew that this should be solved with an event listener on the parent of the buttons. In this case, sure
            you don't have to do it this way. However, what if there was 50 buttons? Do you really want a different function
            for each button? Even though I knew what I wanted to do, I just kept running into small roadblocks each time
            I thought I had it done. I am going to review my JavaScript only here, the HTML and CSS are in the codepen as
            well though.

          <br>
          <p>
            First, I made two variables. One is an element variable named 'para'. This is just a paragraph element to push the calculator
            results to. The other is named 'button-list', this is the parent div that contains each of the operator buttons.
            I added an eventlistener to the 'button-list' div with a 'click' parameter and also a function named 'operate'
            parameter. This will listen for a click within the 'button-list' div and then call the operate function which
            I made next. The 'operate' function starts off with the event being passed in as a parameter and then immediately
            calling preventdefault on the event. This will prevent the page from being reloaded when the buttons are pressed.
            Next, I create two variable elements to access the two numbers that are input.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            When using a form element you can access child elements by using document.forms.'the name of your form'.'the id of the target'.value.
            This will pull that value out for you. Then I created a variable named result and set it equal to a function
            named 'calculate' which I will create next. Finally, I set the 'para' variable .textcontent to be equal to the
            result variable. This will take the result and display it on the document under the Result: heading.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The 'calculate' function takes in three parameters, the first number entered, the second number entered, and the operator.
            What needs to be done right away here is to convert the input strings into numbers. This is done here with parseFloat.
            Next, I just have an else if statement that runs through to check which operator button was pressed. The desired
            operation is then completed and the result is returned.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            This was a fun little exercise that gave me some experience in working with event listeners. Also, I was not aware that I
            could grab values inside of a form the way I did it here. Valuable exercise that I enjoyed.
