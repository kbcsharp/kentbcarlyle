          <h4>#5 Week One Done...</h4>

          <p>Alright, week one is now done and behind me. Just as I expected, this first week went by blazingly fast. The
            experience thus far has been great. I have done a fair amount of self-teaching (online courses and books on my
            own), however, there is nothing like being in a classroom environment like this. Sure, my preparations for this
            camp helped a lot but now adding in-person instruction is really helping everything come together in my mind.
            Every instructor I learn from gives a new perspective and sometimes even a little tidbit that I may not have
            known before. Plus, having others around to bounce ideas and questions off of is really helpful.
          </p>

            In addition to lectures, there were of course some "outside of class" assignments. We have to complete some logic problems
            with JavaScript and mixing in some HTML and CSS as well. The first few were fairly easy for me. However, looking
            ahead to some of the problems that are due in the next few weeks are definitely giving me some struggles. Even
            then, at the moment I am still ahead of the curve on the assignment problems so I am focusing on our other assignment.
            We are to make a static faux store front. I stayed after class on Friday and spent a few hours on that. On Saturday,
            I picked back up on that project. It isn't a requirement to make the page responsive, but I decided to make it
            responsive anyway. This is a great time to really brush up and dive into CSS Grid and Flexbox. I retook a CSS
            Grid and Flexbox course and then finished up the store front static page.

            In addition, a classmate pointed out that they were concerned about using pixels in CSS instead of REMs and EMs. The concern
            with using pixels is that they absolute but not consistent. For instance, the same pixel width on a desktop monitor
            is not the same as on an iPad. This really got me thinking so I researched this topic Saturday morning before
            finishing up the store assignment. There was a lot of wasted time looking for something that really touched on
            what I was looking for but I finally found a great article on the subject. It is a great time to be alive where
            so much information is available readily at the click of a button. Sometimes this information overload is difficult
            to dig through and sift down to what you really need.

            Here is a link to the article <a href="https://css-tricks.com/rem-global-em-local/">css-tricks-px-rem-em-article</a>.
            This is a great article because it includes links and references from earlier articles that give a foundational
            understanding of these different measurement types. Most importantly, it outlines a strategy to use based on
            this information. To summarize, the article suggests using px for the document level, rem for global sizing,
            and em(if needed) for local sizing. I used this strategy for the storeFront project and I really like it. More
            maintainable, organized, and much easier to make changes. Overall, I feel px, rem, and em should be scrapped
            and a new unit measurement unit should take their place. I can dream, but for now I have to use the tools that
            are available the best I can.

            During this week we also had a guest speaker who works in Human Resources. Wow, not only was he an excellent presenter who
            really grabbed my attention but the information provided was invaluable. He talked about resumes, hiring practices,
            and I guess you could say "insider tips" about hiring practices within the industry. If this hour long talk wasn't
            part of the curriculum I would have paid extra to hear it - it was that good. On that note, I will be finishing
            up this weekend touching up my resume and reviewing my Linkedin profile again. Have I mentioned I hate this stuff
            - I just want to code!

            My Labor Day will be spent with family and I will take some rest time. However, I will be digging into topics that we will
            be covering this upcoming shortened week. We will be diving into APIs and JSON so I will be searching for some
            kind of courses on these items. Also, I am going to once again review a JavaScript OOP course to keep this information
            fresh in my mind. Finally, I haven't submitted my store front yet so I keep thinking of things that will make
            it better and revising. I will continue to do this while also ensuring I don't overdo it and miss focusing on
            upcoming topics. I will add the store front to my front-page projects section later this week once it is submitted.
            See you in the next post.
