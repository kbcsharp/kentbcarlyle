            I just can't get over this song! "Different" by Micah Tyler. It's like God gave Micah these words and told him to put this
            song together just for me. When I first heard this song I was literally stopped in my tracks. It felt like I
            walked outside into 130 degree weather and I couldn't breathe for a few seconds. It is so powerful, so beautiful,
            -- yet so concise, so simple. Here are the words to the first bar...
            <br>
            <br> I dont' want to hear anymore
            <br> Teach me to listen
            <br> I don't want to see anymore
            <br> Give me a vision
            <br> That You could move this heart to be set apart
            <br> I don't need to recognize the man in the mirror
            <br> I don't want to trade Your plan for something familiar
            <br> I can't waste a day
            <br> I can't stay the same
          </p>
          <br>

            It seems like in life, we as humans just have to complicate everything. We complicate our relationships. We complicate our
            professional lives. Then we don't get to where we think we should be and wonder -- what happened? What does it
            take to become a good developer? Well, if you ask someone they will say that you work hard, study, and then put
            those skills into practice by buliding applications/websites. However, you still see people that don't do it
            and then they don't get to where they want to be. It's so simple, and that is exactly what makes it so difficult.
            When I hear someone say "this is simple or make it simple", most people will automatically think -- oh just simple
            -- great, this is going to be easy. Surprisingly, though, simple is not easy. Simple is difficult.

            Have you ever worked so hard on a programming problem? For instance, maybe you are challenging yourself with some problems
            on codewarz or coderbyte. You spend tons of time on the problem, you have nested for loops, and really just a
            convoluted mess. For me, sometimes I get a working solution, just not a performant one. Other times, I just can't
            seem to solve it. You then see one of the possible solutions. It is so clear after you see it. It is so simple,
            so concise, -- and you wonder -- why didn't I see this. But you learn from it, you begin to see some patterns
            in the solutions.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In life, in programming, and really in everything -- complicating stuff is easy and simplicity is difficult. I want to strive
            to make my life simple. I want to strive to make my code simple. Simple is just so beautiful...
