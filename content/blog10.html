            We had an API assignment due on Monday. This involved using the NY Times API to pull images and links to articles when a
            user enters a search term and a date range. We broke up into small teams and got in front of class, then went
            over everything line by line. It was challenging and a great learning experience. In addition, it was nice to
            get the opportunity to work with some people in the class that I had not been able to yet. It also gave me some
            experience before choosing my personal API project which was due Thursday.
          </p>

            I ended up choosing the Edamam API which allows recipe and nutrition search. Fortunately we were given plenty of 'lab time'
            to work on our projects and ask questions from the instructors as needed. I could not believe the amount of time
            spent to really get my project working. There is a link in my projects section but I will link it here also,
            <a href="https://recipefinderapi.firebaseapp.com/">RecipeFinder</a>. The good news is that my confidence in working
            with API's is much higher now. It really seems like it depends on who created the API will determine how difficult
            it is to work with. Fun project and I wish I could have done more with it. However, given the time constraints,
            I am happy with the final result.

            Thursday, we all had to present our personal websites and all of the projects completed so far in front of everyone in the
            class. It was interesting to see everyone else's work and also hear a little about everyone's lives. What they
            are at the academy for and how they discovered programming. I did okay with my presentation. I feel like my content
            was strong but just didn't present it properly or in the best light. Looking back, I definitely see the mistakes
            I made so next time I should be better. My confidence in myself and my work is improving and I think that will
            show in my next presentation.

            Friday, we did some linkedin and social networking type things. ZZZZZZZZZ..... We also all received our gold badge certificates.
            There are three badges earned during the 12-week course and this is our first. The best thing about being presented
            our certificates wasn't really receiving them. Instead, we were fortunate to be apart of something else better.
            What happened was we got to see an individual who had been working at Eleven Fifty for three years get her goodbye.
            I could clearly see the emotion and the connection that the leadership here has for each other. It was really
            a great thing to see and experience. I can sense that the leaders here are people of faith. The President gave
            a really powerful message to all of us that really touched my heart and really gave me reassurance that enrolling
            here was the correct choice. That this was the right place for me and that this is truly the path I should be
            on.

            In the afternoon, we had a design workshop. A design expert came in and gave us some great information on design decisions,
            everthing from color choices to typography and font options. Excited for next week as we begin ReactJS. I am
            going to do my best to learn and cram as much React knowledge that I can before Monday rolls around. See you
            in the next post.
