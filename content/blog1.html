          <h4>#1 Orientation...Eleven Fifty Academy...First Impressions</h4>
          <p>20 August 2018</p>

            As you have probably already figured out, I will be attending a coding bootcamp, Eleven Fifty Academy, Fishers, IN. This
            will be the JavaScript SmartStart program that will last 12 weeks and begins August 27, 2018. I have just attended
            orientation this past Friday, August 17.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Now, before orientation everyone was given a student log-in in order to access the required pre-work. This entailed some
            basic JavaScript fundamental reading/exercises as well as a "personal survey". The personal survey covers most
            of your soft skills kind of stuff; resume, linkedin, accomplishments, and more. I definitely found the soft skills
            survey much more tedious, time-consuming, and difficult than the foundational programming stuff.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I arrived to orientation and was greeted by Alex, a staff member at Eleven Fifty Academy. I also ran into Carol, who is their
            Military Outreach Liason. I have cooresponded with Carol via phone and email but this was the first time meeting
            her in person. It was nice to finally meet here face to face. She has been extremely helpful during the entire
            process of enrolling. She gave me a military packet that they had put together (if you couldn't tell already,
            I am a veteran). Then Alex helped me to the orientation classroom. I will say that each of the staff members
            I have been in contact with is excited about the program and I get the feeling that they have a good work culture.
            This is a good sign and helps me feel confident with my decision to be a part of this program.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Orientation started off with expecations of everyone in the program and the values of the academy. Something I really liked
            was the focus on preparing you for a career. I think one of the most important thing I can get from this is an
            understaing of what employers are looking for in the area. They also brought in most of the remaining staff and
            let us meet them. They then took some questions and moved on to some of the foundational programming aspects.
            This is where our instructor, Tim, took over. He just went over basics and wanted to make sure everyone knew
            enough to be able to understand and complete the pre-work.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In my opinion, this was basic and very beginner stuff. Therefore, I tried to focus on scanning the room and trying to determine
            who already had some of this knowledge. This would let me know who else had prepared and was excited about beginning
            this course. I noticed a few people knew some terminal commands and were familiar with much of what was being
            talked about. These are the people I want to sit by when the course begins. I always want to be around people
            smarter, faster, and better than me. This will help me elevate myself and even learn from them.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Orientation lasted a few hours. It was really just to get acquainted with everyone, as well as understand the Academy and
            their values. Overall, I have a good feeling about the program and am very excited to begin. It is going to be
            awesome just being around others who are as excited as I am about tech and programming. This is like a dream
            environment to be in. I can focus all my time for 12-weeks learning and growing as a programmer.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The only downside so far is that the class size is just too large in my opinion. There was 25 people there and the instructor
            told us he expected about 5 more. I think they should have a cap of maybe 20 students. We will see if this has
            a negative impact on my experience. I will be writing at least one blog post each week detailing my experiences
            in this program. See you in the next post.
