            Week 7 was a 4-day week and I spent it working on my blue badge, full-stack project. I have the backend locked down and my
            focus was completely on React and the frontend. I can't believe how much time it took to get all the functionality
            I wanted in my app. As a matter of fact, I thought I was done Friday with functionality and could solely focus
            on styling and animation. I was sadly mistaken. I feel like a firefighting coder. I put a fire out, move on,
            and bam another fire is blazing.

            I am building a flashcard application and everything I need just didn't seem to work properly at first. For instance, I wanted
            to get a note to display on the screen depending on which category button was clicked. My first solution was
            fetch the data needed from the backend on each click. This would pull the row on the table from the backend which
            matched the category selected and this value would go into state. Then I could grab the value from the state
            in render to display on the screen.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The issue here is that you have to click every button twice to display. Fortunately, I finally thought of going about it
            a different way. Instead of doing a fetch to the backend for each button click, just figure out a way to manipulate
            the current data array in state. I ended running a fetch on page load and then taking the data from state through
            a filter. Then render the data I needed from state in the render. It's tons of small issues like this that took
            my time up this week.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            It can be tedious and draining at times but once you get it working, you get to see the functionality come to life and it
            sure makes you feel good. Looking back I feel like I box myself into solving a problem a certain way once I have
            already written that code. Instead, I think I need to be more willing to start tackling the problem from a different
            angle earlier in the process. Had I done that with this problem, I could have solved it quicker and moved on
            to the next implementation.

            Friday morning we had another networking workshop. Some time was spent discussing possible ways the course could finish and
            some experiences previous students had with interviewing and job choices, etc... The main focus after was working
            on an elevator pitch for yourself. Basically, it's a quick, verbal way to explain who you are, what you are about,
            and what you do for a living. I can see how this can be helpful but I just kind of feel weird and insincere with
            this type of stuff. However, I guess another way to look at it is if you don't advertise yourself than how will
            you get noticed in the first place. Either way, two and a half hours was too long for this workshop.

            This weekend I finished all of the 'have to have' functionality and began working on styling my project. I also began to
            look into animation libraries. I have some animation completed on my login/signup page but it took me a lot of
            time to get that done right. The docs just don't describe things in such a way to make it easy to get started.
            I feel like if I knew someone that had used this particular animation library before, they could have explained
            the basics to me in 1/4 of the time it took for me to do it alone. I really, really want to get some animations
            for my flashcards and notes but I only have a few days left. I also want to get a profile page that loads upon
            sign in and maybe a photo with it. Finally, I need to review a few edge cases that could occur with some of the
            functionality with my app. Most of this isn't really 'must-haves' but I really want to make them happen. I only
            have Monday and Tuesday left. I will find out quickly here if I am able to get the final look I want. If not,
            hopefully I get close enough.
