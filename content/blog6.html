            I want to use this blog post to list some of my favorite learning materials and online instructors etc. To prepare for this
            bootcamp I knew I needed to find a good JavaScript course. I like to scan youtube and twitter for quality courses
            and prominent developers that can provide value to me. About a month and half before this bootcamp began, I found
            Mosh Hamedani on YouTube. He offers roughly the first 30 minutes of his courses free there. Watching those, I
            really enjoyed his style, pace, structure, and depth. Mosh is a godsend and an absolutely phenomenal instructor.
            I took his JS Basics and JS OOP course. If you purchase them, you will not be disappointed. You can usually snag
            them for about $10 a piece on Udemy and rewatch whenever you want. I can't say enough about Mosh - probably my
            favorite online instructor at the moment. I have also purchased his ReactJS and nodeJS course. His node course
            is available at Udemy, however his React course is presently only available on his website,
            <a href="https://www.codewithmosh.com">codewithmosh.com</a>. I have not taken the node or React courses yet,
            but his first courses were so well done, I can't imagine these not being a homerun as well. This is why I went
            ahead and purhased them now.
          </p>
          <br>

            Another great developer whose courses have really helped me is Wes Bos. His courses are available at wesbos.com. You sign
            up there and then each course he provides has it's own website. You use the same login for each site once you
            sign up. I really enjoyed his CSS Grid and Flexbox courses. The great thing is, these are free. Now, all of his
            courses are not free but these two are. These are gold and are my go-to when I need to get a solid visual represenation
            of how these work in practice. He also has a great podcast named syntaxFM. He is a JavaScript developer so this
            podcast is always filled with great stuff for me. Instead of jamming to some tunes on the way to bootcamp, listen
            to his podcast. A few weeks ago, he covered React and the most recent podcast has him and his co-host exchanging
            interview questions. Solid questions and it is interesting listening to two seasoned indie-developers answer
            these. It is a must listen.

            When it comes to books, I found the 'You Don't Know JS' series to be great and 'Eloquent JavaScript' to be solid as well.
            I have not yet completed these, but what I have done so far is excellent. The great thing about these is they
            are FREE as well. Quality content for free, can't beat that. My overall favorite though has to be 'JavaScript
            the Good Parts'. It is definitely long in the tooth but still relevant. Douglas Crockford is great and also has
            given many many great presenations at conferences. Find them on YouTube, you will not be disappointed.

            In addition to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS - I really wanted to at least have some understanding of data structures and algorithms.
            I can't remember how I found out about these two courses but I really enjoyed them. The courses are 'Learning
            Algorithms in JavaScript from Scratch' and 'Learning Data Structures in JavaScript from Scratch' by Eric Traub.
            These are located on Udemy and can typically be purchased for around $10. Fortunatley, these are done in JavaScript
            which I remember being fairly difficult to find.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Finally, finding great developers with great content on twitter is important. I retweet and like so many things. This makes
            it really easy to go back and find the things that interest you or can provide value to what you are learning.
            I would have a really long list here so if you want to see who I follow, click my twitter link at the footer
            of this page and you scan through. I am sure there is so much more out there and I am just scratching the surface.
            For now this is keeping me busy while I grow as a developer. See you in the next post.
