            Week 6 is through and we are half way done. Wow! This week was mostly lab time to really dig through the Node and React Git
            books as well as work on our blue badge project. For our project we are using the PERN(Postgres, Express, React,
            and Node) stack. For our database we need to have three tables. I have all three of my tables together and tested
            working with Postman. I have the front end authorization log in and sign up completed working.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Right now, I will just keep moving and hopefully I am mainly working with React and figuring out how to manipulate the data,
            align it, and style it how I want. Finally getting to a point where you can actually see some results from your
            investment is exciting. Just because I am finally seeing data doesn't mean I still don't have a ways to go though.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I am at a point where I have completed our Git book on Node multiple times so my comfort level with the backend in this regard
            is certainly rising. We were also given our React Gitbook so I was able to go over that through the 3-day weekend.
            This is what brings the React frontend in connection with the database. The backend is still not as fun but it
            is much better for me now that everything is coming together and my knowledge/familiarity with it is increasing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In addition to the project, we had a small React challenge. I did well with that challenge so that gives me some confidence.
              In addition, the instructor did three (Wedensday, Thursday, Friday) 2-hour React sessions to help everyone
              expand their knowledge. In addition, most everyone has been hammering away with node so it was good to ensure
              we don't forget about the frontend.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Friday afternoon, we had a testing workshop. This was an individual from a company by the name of iLab. Great guy with some
              solid big picture information about testing. He also didn't drag on and on. He got to the point and gave us
              the information in a reasonable time frame. Another good note is he has all of our emails and sent the slides
              immediately after. Awesome and thank you. However, I think I was really hoping for somewhat more of a specific
              testing workshop. I was hoping maybe we would actually see how to write tests for our code. I always hear how
              testing and T.D.D. are so important. I suppose this will come with time after learning more of the basics.
              <br>

              Looks like this week will hopefully be all about React and the frontend if I don't have any issues. Hoping I can figure out
              a nice way to layout my flashcard app. React is still tough but I am starting to "think in React" finally.
              This should be a stressful but fun shortened week.

            <h4>Sidenote:</h4>
            <p>
              Myself and some others taking the various courses at Eleven Fifty Academy are using our G.I. Bill. Most of us still have
              not been properly enrolled and have not received any of our benefits. I believe some of this is the school's
              fault and of course unsurprisingly some of it is the VA's fault. Regardless, Eleven Fifty really stepped up
              for the veterans.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              They offered everyone an interest free loan while they sort out the issues with enrollment with the VA. Once we receieve
              our benefits, we will then pay them back. Some people were relying on these benefits to survive during this
              course. They did not have to do this, but it was the right thing to do and really displays that this school
              cares about people. Seeing this done made me feel really great about this place. If you are a veteran they
              will take care of you.
