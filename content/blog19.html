            Two thirds of the way through this course! Definitely going to miss the environment and the people, going by quickly! The
            first two days of week 8 I spent completing my logic and styling for my flashcard/notes React app. Also, I separated
            the client and backend into two repos into Git to prepare for Wednesday. Wednesday is when we pushed our code
            to heroku and get it up and running live. Overall, I am happy with my project and I would grade it as A-/B+ work.
            Really solid but just not quite where I wanted it to be. This is on the front page under the Projects sections,
            it is called FlashNotez. This is a free app, so when it is first loaded up it takes about 15 seconds to get going.
            After that, it works as normal.

            I feel like I needed a few more animations and a little more polish and I could have gotten it to my initial vision. One
            more day would have been great. I did spend a few hours this past weekend cleaning up some logic. I also attempted
            to get tooltips working on multiple decks in the app but couldn't get it to only show with the correct item being
            hovered. All of the tooltips kept showing up at once. I want to spend more time on it but my time needs to be
            spent now on learning Angular. It's like as soon as I start to understand something and get to enjoy it, we have
            to move onto something else.

            Wedensday was definitely a long day. Deploying to heroku was a nightmare and there were lots of problems. Fortunately, early
            afternoon, I was able to get my app up and running. However, some others in the class could not say the same.
            The instructors were great though and I know they stayed late to do their best to get everyone's project live.
            Thursday, we each presented our projects. I think I presented my project in a slightly better fashion than last
            time but really, just not good enough. I feel like I have to get up there and be in some 90's informecial and
            then start going through my code for no reason other than to show off. I don't like playing games so if you don't
            play the game, I guess you can't really win. Oh well, It was neat to see everyone else's ideas and implmentations
            though.

            Friday, to prepare for the next badge, we were paired up with another person to work on a simple html/css mini project. I
            think it was just to get used to coding with other people and working with others you are not familiar with.
            It was a good change of pace because I was able to work with someone that I really never talked to much before.
            It was an enjoyable experience for sure. We also had a nice celebratory lunch -- fried chicken and The Office
            playing on a big TV -- good times.

            Over the weekend after finishing some things on my React project, I worked an hour or two with Angular and began to prepare
            for the last badge. This is a team project and they will decide our teams on Wednesday. Hoping for the best because
            who you work with, whether it is on the job or in a classroom like this, really determines your happiness and
            ultimately the end result.
