            Bang! Welcome to week 4. I was so worn out from finishing gold badge, I just didn't have my usual drive last weekend. I was
            just mentally drained and unfortunately I didn't get near as deep into React as I wanted to before Monday morning.
            The truth is, I needed a break and just couldn't spend every waking moment at home in front of the computer and
            learning. The good news is I felt refreshed this week and I am feeling great this weekend because of that decision.
            I really wish we had a week off in between badges, but we don't, so I just have to fight through and work that
            much harder.
          </p>

            Monday, right away we covered ES6. This is important since with React there is class usage, arrow functions, and many other
            functions such as map that are commonly used. Right after this, we dove into our 'Git book' activities. This
            book is basically projects involving React with step by step instructions so we can learn how to build with this
            library.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Tuesday, we started off with a challenge that seemed fairly simple. However, it of course needs to be done using React so
            it seems so much more difficult. Until you see the answer, then of course it makes sense. Let me tell you, React
            is hard and it just has a different and unconventional way of doing things. It is really difficult to wrap my
            head around and this was a really tough week. After our challenge, we went over a possible solution in class.
            Afterwards, we went back into our 'Git books' to plow through some more React projects.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The rest of the week kept the same pattern as Tuesday. Begin with a challenge, review solutions to the challenge, and then
            work on React projects in our "Git books". On the surface, it appears like it would be much easier than previous
            weeks but it is not. There is a reason this week is setup in this way. Did I mention React is difficult and hard
            to grasp! Now that the week is over, I am on my 6th day of learning React and I am definitely feeling more comfortable
            and things are coming together. However, this is not the pace I expected of myself.
          </p>

            Last night and today, I have been immersed in <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v4/">Brian
              Holt's intro to react v4 on frontendmasters.com</a>. I also am really enjoying <a href="https://codewithmosh.com">Mosh
              Hamedani's Mastering React
            </a>. At the moment I am about 1/2 way through Mosh's course and 3/4 the way through Brian's course. My goal
            is to complete these two before the weekend is over. Also, right after finishing these I want to hit one more
            React project in our "Git books" so I can see if I am able to apply this knowledge and really begin to grow my
            understanding with React.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I will be continuing to constantly work with React even after this section is over in the course. I want to specialize in
            React and I am not going to give up. I keep hearing that the majority of the people in this class will be working
            with a different programming language and/or library when they get hired after this course. My goal is for that
            NOT to be me and really dive deep into React and get what I want. Which is to specialize and build a career working
            with JS and React. Well, for now at least. Front-end technologies change so fast, who knows where we will be
            in five years. Next week, we begin our journey into back-end, specifically Node. Going to be another exciting
            week.
