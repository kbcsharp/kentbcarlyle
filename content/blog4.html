          <p> Before I get to the first day of class at Eleven Fifty, I want to recap over how my final preparations went.
            Well, I was able to spend a few hours reviewing the JavaScript basics and OOP courses. However, I was not able
            to rehash the algorithms and data structures courses. I began one React course and after the first hour I was
            feeling sort of lost. I then tried a different course with a different instructor and found myself feeling the
            same. I took a step back and decided to really start with baby steps. I am not a big fan of codecademy but I
            went there and took their basic React course. Finally, some things finally started to click for me. I also began
            to look at the official React learning docs as well as some guidance I found on reactiflux.com. I didn't have
            time to dive in further. Unfortunatley, I really felt I needed to redo my resume and spend more time on the soft
            skills stuff. As much as I don't enjoy it, the soft skills stuff is just as important as coding prowess.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p> Moving on to the first day of class, which was today. I got there early and got the back row which I really
            wanted. I just want to be able to stand whenever I want and not obstruct the view of someone else. As time neared
            for class to begin, I counted about 25 classmates. I wrote previously that I felt the class was overcrowded but
            I don't necessarily feel that way now. There was the main instructor, an assistant instructor, as well as two
            individuals that completed the bootcamp previously. They are all there to help and instruct - it really seems
            well balanced and hopefully this continues. I also just happened to sit next to two other veterans. Of course,
            we have a lot in common and this really helped me feel more comfortable this first day. They are good guys that
            will definitely make the class even more enjoyable.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p> The instructor covered HTML, CSS, and JS beginner stuff with a few small projects sprinkled in throughout the
            day. It is always a good thing to hammer down fundamentals. Most of the information I am familiar with so it
            feels good knowing all that preparing is already paying off. However, I still learned some new stuff. No matter
            what you think you know, there is always more information that you don't know. We also had a fun 'animation'
            project for tonight which I have now completed. I was certainly hoping to come home tonight and start moving
            ahead with some React courses. However, it is already 10PM and I am about to crash. This day absolutely flew
            by and it seems like I am going to blink and this 12 weeks will be over. This is a lot of fun and time goes by
            fast when you are having fun. This weekend for my next blog post I will discuss some of my favorite learning
            materials and rehash over this first week. See you in the next post.
