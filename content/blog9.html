          <p>
            I'm uncomfortable writing these blog posts. I'm uncomfortable sharing my thoughts like this. I'm uncomfortable putting myself
            out there. However, I told myself I was going to stick to this, so I am. You know what? I'm glad. I thought it
            would be a chore but I'm beginning to enjoy it in a strange way. It is giving me perspective. It is helping me
            realize that maybe doing things I find uncomfortable is a smart strategy.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Now that I have made a choice to do this which makes me uncomfortable, why not other things? I want to begin seeking out
            things that make me uncomfortable and fearful. I'm missing out on life and my full potential. I'm missing out
            on experiences and artificially limiting my horizons. It's like I knew this but fear always seemed to win. Why?
            Because it isn't easy -- especially at first. I'm beginning to see things differently.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I absolutely do not feel comfortable being in front of a group and speaking. Everyone is staring at me, my heart is pounding,
            and I just want to get it over with. What if I embrace that fear, embrace the experience, embrace what makes
            me uncomfortable? What is the worst that could happen? Maybe I have some embarrasment? Is that small cost really
            worth limiting my life experiences and not doing new, difficult things.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I began learning to code not too long ago. At the very very beginning, I thought at times -- maybe I just wasn't born to
            code. These other people were just naturally understanding everything. I was wrong. Just like writing these posts
            is getting me over that first hurdle and providing a glimpse of light over the first mountain of fear. I'm getting
            to a point in programming where I have gone over some hills and can actually see/visualize my path. Imposter
            syndrome is strong, but I can see my growth and that gives me confidence.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I'm understanding. I'm realizing that I'm gaining the ability to do things I didn't think I could do before. What else can
            I achieve in my life if I face other fears? Maybe fear is a liar. If I am not uncomfortable, I'm not really making
            myself better. I'm just being safe.

            <img id="chuckles" src="../../images/chuckles.jpg"> My son is 4 years old, has autism, and can't speak.....yet.
            I ask a lot of him everyday. He's nudged to communicate in everyday tasks and sometimes with more rigorous speech
            therapy. It is not easy for him and there is a lot of frustration on his part. My son is facing this and has
            to be uncomfortable every day in order to grow. If I am gonna ask him to do this, I can be uncomfortable too.
            It's ironic and of course he doesn't know this -- but he is actually teaching me. I want to be different, I want
            to be changed, I want to grow, I want to be uncomfortable. See you in the next post.
