            As of 16 November, I have graduated from Eleven Fifty Academy's JavaScript course.   As I previously wrote, this last part of the course, also known as red badge,
            is done in teams.  Our project was done with Angular as the front end and Node with postgres as the backend.  In addition to the team assignment,
            we had multiple small individual assigments.  Our team's final project was an educational application that acts as a supplement to the training you receive
            in class.  The user can register, login, and comment on each learning section provided.  Also, users are able to add their own education resources to the site in 
            one convenient place.  Working with a group was an interesting experience and the best part was really learning how to use git/github more in depth and in a team environment.  It was
            also nice to get some experience working with Angular and seeing the similarities and patterns with React.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            This last badge, they really tried to encourage self-drive and solving problems completely within the team.  I think this
            was great because being a developer is about solving problems.  With programming, there is always going to be an issue that pops up or an unexpected problem, adapting and figuring out a solution
            is what it is all about.  In addition, Eleven Fifty offers career services including help with resumes, interviews, and even helping you find a job that fits you.  This last badge I began to focus 
            more on my resume and job seeking.  Utilizing career services helped my get my resume up to date and inline with what employers expect and want.
            
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The program was really great and helped propel my programming skills.  The networking and relationships built in the classroom is life changing as well.  They have also recently introduced a purple badge
            to the course.  This is completely optional but is free of charge and has been great so far.  This is my first week in purple badge.  This badge is about self-learning to freshen up on coding fundamentals,  enhance previous
            projects, begin new projects, and expand your knowledge base.  All the things that will increase the value that you can bring to a potential employer.  They have you create a written plan for the badge showing what you are working
            on each day.  This also includes meeting with career services and actively applying for jobs.  This is definitely more self-learning in comparison to the rest of the program but instructors are still around to help and even provide short
            lessons to help us out.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I'm excited for this stage and will be working on constantly reviewing JavaScript fundamentals and taking new courses to learn more.  Right now I am focusing on taking React courses and then I will begin a project in React.  I have really just began
            my job search but as I gain some more experience from contact with multiple employers, I will update anything I have noticed or learned.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Thank you to my wife for sacrificing in so many ways to allow me to attend this course and begin my new career as a developer.  Also, the many nights coding and learning at home which will still be persisting for the near future.
            There is still more sacrifices, especially until I find permanement employment.  However, I know she believes in me and will support me
            all the way to the end just like she always has in everything else.
