            This week was a 4-day week so it went by very fast of course. We began learning bootstrap and how to apply it to websites.
            How to use it properly to layout your website and create repsonsiveness. I can see where bootstrap has its place
            but I'm just not a big fan. I prefer to use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create my layouts. In addition, then using
            media queries to get the end result I am looking for. I suppose if you begin using bootstrap all the time and
            begin remembering all the class names, then it can be quick and powerful. It just turns into HTML 'div'-itis.
            I mean there is just so many divs all over the place. I feel Grid and Flexbox are the present and definitely
            the future. Cleaner and simpler in my opinion. However, there is no denying the popularity of bootstrap. So,
            I am glad to get some experince with it and begin to understand what it can do and how it is implemented.

            Wedensday and Thursday were really all about callback functions, promises, and working with APIs. We have some excellent
            practice API assignments. These are preparing us for our own project that is due this week. We use an API and
            apply it to a site we build. It should be a fun project but right now I am still trying to come up with a unique
            idea or way to implement an API from the list we were given. I'm sure I will come up with something after more
            brainstorming. When it is finished I will post it in the projects section. We also did some white board challenges.
            They were fun and a little nerve-wracking. I think white board coding is good practice. I don't feel that they
            should necessarily be used in interviews. When are you ever going to code on a white board to actually create
            something? Everyone does it just to prepare for an interview. Regardless of how I feel, the reality is that is
            that this is how they are used. So, I suppose I better get some practice in with it. Maybe my opinion will change
            over time.

            Friday, we had an all-day Agile workshop. A represenative from a company named beLithe presented and went through many slides.
            He also added different interactive activities throughout the day to show us first hand how Scrum works in practice.
            I have to be honest, I was dreading this day and thought it would be a waste. I just wanted to code and work
            on the projects that we have upcoming which will be due next week. In saying that, I ended up being pleasantly
            surprised. It was really great information and it is great knowledge to have. I just wish I wasn't so tired during
            it all and hope I am able to retain this knowledge over the course of the bootcamp. If Bob Martin is a pioneer
            and believer in TDD, Agile... I should have known this is the way to go and that this workshop would be interesting.
            Going back to being tired. There is a lot to learn and you need to learn it fast. I'm beginning to have trouble
            sleeping. I am so tired but when I try to sleep, I just can't stop thinking about my projects and what else I
            need to learn. It's crazy, I can't stop my mind from running at 100mph. I'd like to dream in code but first I
            need to be able to fall asleep.
