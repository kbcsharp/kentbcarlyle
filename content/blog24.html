						<h4>#23 The Spinning Plates...</h4>

						<p>
							My second week as a Junior Software Engineer is
							complete and I am enjoying it so far. The work I am
							doing is not exactly the web development(.NET Core,
							React) that I am eventually hoping for. However, it
							is a great experience and I am continuing to prepare
							for other development opportunities that might
							become available in the future. I have really been
							focused on learning C# and .NET Core fundamentals
							but recently I have just began to shift some focus
							back to JavaScript and React.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I am not abandoning C# and .NET Core learning but I
							want to stay fresh and relevant on all the
							technologies I may be involved with. Recently, I
							felt the need to really dive into those but now I
							need to ensure I keep my knowledge/skills up to date
							with JS/React as well. This company has both .NET
							Core and React developers and I know of a possible
							opportunity outside this company which involves
							React. I am not sure what the future holds but I
							need to be ready for whatever is thrown my way. It
							is tough to decide what to learn and it feels like I
							have so many different things spinning at once.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							This weekend I decided to begin converting my
							personal website to use React. It is not really
							necessary, but it will give me something to jump
							back into React with and I do have a few
							ideas/changes to try during the conversion. Now that
							I have started, I am already feeling more confident
							by the minute and doing some front-end work again is
							kind of fun. Not sure when it will be completed but
							it will be a side project I will be working on
							during my off-time.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							In addition to converting this website to React, I
							am also trying to read more. I just started a
							popular book by the name of "The Pragmatic
							Programmer". by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. I'm
							only one chapter in and it seems like a solid book
							with --- you guessed it -- lots of practical advice
							about the world of software development. I will also
							continue to study C#, .NET Core and review the code
							that the more experienced developers have written to
							continue to wrap my head around that paradigm. Also,
							every opportunity I get to talk with the .NET Core
							developers I will. The short time I have had to talk
							to them, they have given some great tips while also
							answering some curiosities I had about the
							technology. At the moment, I do not work direct with
							the React developers but I will attempt to engage
							with at least one of them soon. It's a balancing act
							trying to learn and retain all I can about
							everything, but for now that is what makes it
							interesting.
